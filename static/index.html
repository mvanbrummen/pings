    <h1>Pings</h1>
    <h2>Storing data</h2>
    <p>The server should accept POST requests that contain a device_id and an epoch_time. The two should be stored together - each device ID can have many epoch times (each representing a ping).

For example, for device ID eab88fbc-10c6-11e2-b622-1231381359d0, to record a ping at 2016-02-24 12:52:44 +1000 you'd make a POST to /eab88fbc-10c6-11e2-b622-1231381359d0/1456282364.

You can use any method you like for storing the underlying data, and we'll be interested to hear your thoughts on what you chose. Data persistence is important so in-memory-only solutions are not recommended.</p>
    <h2>Retrieving data for a specific device</h2>
    <p>The server should accept GET requests to query ping times for specific device IDs, or for all device IDs. This should work in two formats: /deviceID/:date or /deviceID/:from/:to.

:date must be an ISO formatted date (YYYY-MM-DD). This represents all pings for that date in the UTC time zone. For example the request /:deviceId/2016-02-24 would get all pings for the device between 2016-02-24 00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and 2016-02-25 00:00:00 UTC (exclusive).

:from, and :to should accept either dates or unix timestamps. If they are ISO dates, the logic above applies. In general, :to should be exclusive, but :from should be inclusive. Thus, all of the following requests should return the same data:</p>
    <h2>Retrieving data for all devices</h2>
    <p>Finally, replacing the device_id parameter with the string all should return data for all device IDs, formatted as a hash. This should work for all the different requests mentioned above, including /all/:date, and /all/:from/:to.</p>
    <h2>Retrieving a list of devices</h2> 
    <p>GET /devices should return a list of device IDs:</p>
    <h2>Deleting data</h2> 
    <p>If a POST is made to /clear_data, the server should delete all stored data</p>
